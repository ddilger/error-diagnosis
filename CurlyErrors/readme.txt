The main program for diagnosing curly brace balancing errors, 
curly_diagnosis.c, runs by reading token files.

Files are tokenized by a lexer, lexer.c. This lexer could use
improvement but is suitable for the test cases.

There are 21 test cases, each of which is named by JavaCurly#.java,
where # is a number 1 through 21. Each of these test cases has a
corresponding token file, named JavaCurly#.txt.

A python script, tokenizer.py, creates each of the 21 token files
using the lexer.

Another python script, tester.py, runs the curly_diagnosis program on
each of the test cases, printing out the expected output for the file
and then the actual output generated by curly_diagnosis. It makes
checking expected versus actual behavior easy.
